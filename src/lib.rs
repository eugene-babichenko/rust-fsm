//! A framework for building finite state machines in Rust
//!
//! The `rust-fsm` crate provides a simple and universal framework for building
//! state machines in Rust with minimum effort.
//!
//! The essential part of this crate is the
//! [`StateMachineImpl`](trait.StateMachineImpl.html) trait. This trait allows a
//! developer to provide a strict state machine definition, e.g. specify its:
//!
//! * An input alphabet - a set of entities that the state machine takes as
//!   inputs and performs state transitions based on them.
//! * Possible states - a set of states this machine could be in.
//! * An output alphabet - a set of entities that the state machine may output
//!   as results of its work.
//! * A transition function - a function that changes the state of the state
//!   machine based on its current state and the provided input.
//! * An output function - a function that outputs something from the output
//!   alphabet based on the current state and the provided inputs.
//! * The initial state of the machine.
//!
//! Note that on the implementation level such abstraction allows build any type
//! of state machines:
//!
//! * A classical state machine by providing only an input alphabet, a set of
//!   states and a transition function.
//! * A Mealy machine by providing all entities listed above.
//! * A Moore machine by providing an output function that do not depend on the
//!   provided inputs.
//!
//! # Use
//!
//! Initially this library was designed to build an easy to use DSL for defining
//! state machines on top of it. Using the DSL will require to connect an
//! additional crate `rust-fsm-dsl` (this is due to limitation of the procedural
//! macros system).
//!
//! ## Using the DSL for defining state machines
//!
//! The DSL is parsed by the `state_machine` macro. Here is a little example.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use rust_fsm::*;
//!
//! state_machine! {
//!     derive(Debug)
//!     CircuitBreaker(Closed)
//!
//!     Closed(Unsuccessful) => Open [SetupTimer],
//!     Open(TimerTriggered) => HalfOpen,
//!     HalfOpen => {
//!         Successful => Closed,
//!         Unsuccessful => Open [SetupTimer]
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This code sample:
//!
//! * Defines a state machine called `CircuitBreaker`;
//! * Derives the `Debug` trait for it (the `derive` section is optional);
//! * Sets the initial state of this state machine to `Closed`;
//! * Defines state transitions. For example: on receiving the `Successful`
//!   input when in the `HalfOpen` state, the machine must move to the `Closed`
//!   state;
//! * Defines outputs. For example: on receiving `Unsuccessful` in the
//!   `Closed` state, the machine must output `SetupTimer`.
//!
//! This state machine can be used as follows:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // Initialize the state machine. The state is `Closed` now.
//! let mut machine: StateMachine<CircuitBreaker> = StateMachine::new();
//! // Consume the `Successful` input. No state transition is performed.
//! let _ = machine.consume(&CircuitBreakerInput::Successful);
//! // Consume the `Unsuccesful` input. The machine is moved to the `Open`
//! // state. The output is `SetupTimer`.
//! let output = machine.consume(&CircuitBreakerInput::Unsuccesful).unwrap();
//! // Check the output
//! if output == Some(CircuitBreakerOutput::SetupTimer) {
//!     // Set up the timer...
//! }
//! // Check the state
//! if machine.state() == &CircuitBreakerState::Open {
//!     // Do something...
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! As you can see, the following entities are generated:
//!
//! * An empty structure `CircuitBreaker` that implements the `StateMachineImpl`
//!   trait.
//! * Enums `CircuitBreakerState`, `CircuitBreakerInput` and
//!   `CircuitBreakerOutput` that represent the state, the input alphabet and
//!   the output alphabet respectively.
//!
//! Note that if there is no outputs in the specification, the output alphabet
//! is set to `()`. The set of states and the input alphabet must be non-empty
//! sets.
//!
//! ## Without DSL
//!
//! The `state_machine` macro has limited capabilities (for example, a state
//! cannot carry any additional data), so in certain complex cases a user might
//! want to write a more complex state machine by hand.
//!
//! All you need to do to build a state machine is to implement the
//! `StateMachineImpl` trait and use it in conjuctions with some of the provided
//! wrappers (for now there is only `StateMachine`).
//!
//! You can see an example of the Circuit Breaker state machine in the
//! [project repository][repo].
